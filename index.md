## IMPORTANT UPDATE

Due to concerns over COVID-19, we will not host any onsite locations in 2020. Instead, this year’s contest will take place online. The test will still take place during the same time period (approximately 1-4pm mountain time on March 21, 2020).

To prepare for this, we need all students to do the following:

1. Each student must identify an adult (can be a parent or guardian) who is willing to proctor the test and ensure that the rules are followed (siblings can have the same adult as their proctor).
1. You must re-register for the contest using the below link, including your proctor’s email address so that we can contact them.

Detailed instructions for how to proctor will be sent to the proctor’s email address.

## Format & Scoring

The Utah Math Olympiad is a 3-hour test with 6 questions designed to test a student's creativity and ability to form a rigorous mathematical proof. We favor questions that are interesting, elegant, and accessible. However, they are also designed to be very challenging, and they generally increase in difficulty from problem 1 to problem 6. In order to get credit for a problem, a student must write a convincing argument that proves their answer. This is not the same as merely showing one's work, nor is it the same as explaining every step in great detail.

Each problem is worth 7 points, for 42 points possible. Partial credit is awarded for significant progress toward a correct solution. We take great effort to assign scores appropriately and consistently. While no grading scheme is infallible, decisions of the graders will be final.

Previous contests are available on the [Problems and Solutions](problems) page.

## Eligibility

Any Utah student who has not completed 12th grade and is 19 years old or younger is eligible to participate.

## Prizes

Prizes will be awarded to the top five scorers. Prize denominations will depend on ties and the amount of money available. See the results page using the link above to see previous years' prizes.
